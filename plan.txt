Create a multi token discord logger

First we need to create the libary:
	We need to register clients.
	We pass the libary a token or a set of tokens and register them as clients.
	Then we connect each client to the websocket and give them a id.
	If the client dies we try and reconnect them.
	
	What we should not do:
		We should not take away controll from the end user.
		We should be pretty verbose in our logs incase anything bugs out..

Secondly we create the logger:
	We need to create on_ methods to register as methods such as on_message.
	Since the lib looks for on_ events example is on_ready(), which indicates a client readiness for reading
	We can but should not handle client reconnects and disconnects we should but are not require to give that controll to the libary.
	
Libary Client structure:
	
	i(loop, token):
		registers a client for a id and task
